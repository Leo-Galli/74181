## Introduction at this ALU
> The 74181 is a 4-bit slice arithmetic logic unit (ALU), implemented as a 7400 series TTL integrated circuit. Introduced by Texas Instruments in February 1970,[1] it was the first complete ALU on a single chip.[2] It was used as the arithmetic/logic core in the CPUs of many historically significant minicomputers and other devices.
 The 74181 represents an evolutionary step between the CPUs of the 1960s, which were constructed using discrete logic gates, and single-chip microprocessors of the 1970s. Although no longer used in commercial products, the 74181 later was used in hands-on computer architecture courses and is still referenced in textbooks and technical papers.
