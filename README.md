## üß† Introduction to the 74181 ALU

The **74181** is a revolutionary 4-bit slice arithmetic logic unit (ALU), originally introduced by **Texas Instruments** in 1970. It is historically significant as:
- The **first complete ALU on a single chip**.
- A crucial milestone in transitioning from discrete logic gate CPUs (1960s) to single-chip microprocessors (1970s).

Although it's no longer used commercially, it remains a key teaching tool in **computer architecture** courses.
